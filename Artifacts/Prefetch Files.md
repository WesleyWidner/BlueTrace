### ⚙️ Importance of **Prefetch Files** in Forensics

**Prefetch files** (`.pf`) are created by Windows to **speed up application launch times**. But in forensics, they’re a goldmine for discovering:

* **Which executables were run**
* **How many times they were executed**
* **When they were last executed**
* **What files were loaded during execution**

📁 **Location:**

```
C:\Windows\Prefetch\
```

Each `.pf` file is named like this:

```
<ExecutableName>-<Hash>.pf
e.g., CHROME.EXE-AB12CD34.pf
```

### 🕵️‍♂️ What Prefetch Files Reveal

| Artifact                     | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Executable name**          | The name of the program that was run                                         |
| **Run count**                | How many times it has executed                                               |
| **Last execution timestamp** | When it was last run (sometimes includes the 8 most recent)                  |
| **Loaded DLLs and files**    | A list of files loaded during execution—used for malware detection           |
| **Device and volume ID**     | Unique identifiers for source drives (useful in USB or shadow copy analysis) |

This makes Prefetch one of the most **effective sources of execution history**, even if an app has since been deleted.

### 🔍 How BlueTrace Handles Prefetch Files

BlueTrace includes a **Prefetch Files** module that collects key metadata:

1. **Scans for `.pf` files** in the standard Prefetch directory
2. Extracts the following data for each:

   * `Name`: Filename of the prefetch file
   * `Path`: Full file system location
   * `SizeKB`: Size in kilobytes
   * `Modified`: Last modified time (i.e., *last execution timestamp*)
   * `Section`: `"PrefetchFiles"` for filtering/export

> 🔸 **Note:** BlueTrace does **not parse internal binary contents** like run counts or DLL load lists directly—it flags presence and metadata for further analysis.

### 🛠 For Deep Dive Analysis (External Tools)

To fully parse Prefetch contents, use specialized forensic tools such as:

* **Eric Zimmerman's [PECmd](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)** – Full prefetch parser (run counts, timestamps, loaded modules)
* **WinPrefetchView (NirSoft)** – GUI-based viewer of `.pf` contents
* **Prefetch Parser scripts** – e.g., PowerShell or Python-based

These tools can extract additional timestamps and DLL paths not shown in BlueTrace.

### ✅ Use Cases in Investigations

* **Malware Execution Traces**: Prefetch survives even after malware is deleted
* **User Activity Timeline**: Shows what ran and when
* **Persistence Detection**: Repeated launches from temp/AppData
* **Script/Tool Usage**: Tracks investigator or attacker tools run locally

### 📘 Summary

> Prefetch files are a powerful forensic artifact for discovering what programs ran and when. BlueTrace collects essential metadata for timeline correlation and flags them for offline deep parsing using tools like PECmd.
