Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function checks for the presence of the SYSTEM registry hive file, which contains key configuration data for the operating system, hardware, and system services.
- Path and Exists indicate whether the hive can be collected for forensic imaging or offline analysis.
- The Note field provides next steps, since SYSTEM is a binary file requiring specialized parsing tools.
- SYSTEM hive data is crucial for digital forensics, malware analysis, and incident response, as it reveals boot configuration, device drivers, service settings, and other OS-level details that can be used to investigate persistence, attacks, or system changes.
