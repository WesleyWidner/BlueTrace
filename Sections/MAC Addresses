Information Pulled:  
- InterfaceAlias: The name or alias of each physical network adapter that is currently up
- MACAddress: The MAC (Media Access Control) address of each network adapter
- LinkSpeed: The connection speed of each network adapter
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "MACAddresses"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all physical network adapters that are currently active (status "Up") and collects key information for each.
- InterfaceAlias and MACAddress uniquely identify each physical network interface, supporting asset tracking, network monitoring, and forensic investigations.
- LinkSpeed helps assess network capability and detect unusual network configurations.
- Collecting MAC address and interface data is important for digital forensics, network troubleshooting, inventory management, and security monitoring, as it provides a basis for correlating network activity with specific hardware on the system.
