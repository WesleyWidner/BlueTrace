Information Pulled:  
- FullName: The complete file system path to each file in the user's TEMP directory (recursively)
- Length: The size of each temporary file in bytes
- LastWriteTime: The last modified timestamp of each file (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)
- SHA256: The SHA-256 cryptographic hash of each file's contents
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "TempFolderContents"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects metadata for all files found in the user's TEMP directory and its subfolders.
- FullName identifies where each temporary file is stored, which is helpful in locating suspicious or potentially sensitive files that could be left behind by applications or malware.
- Length gives the size of each file, which helps in prioritizing analysis or cleanup.
- LastWriteTime shows when the file was last modified, which can help correlate temporary file creation or changes with system events or possible compromise.
- SHA256 provides a unique identifier for each file's contents, useful for integrity checking and for matching files against known malicious or sensitive file hashes.
- Collecting this data supports digital forensics, incident response, and system maintenance by highlighting transient files that may hold evidence of user or attacker activity.
