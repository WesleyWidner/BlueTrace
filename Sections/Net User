Information Pulled:  
- Username: The name of each local user account found on the system
- Collected: The date and time the username was collected (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "NetUser"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function runs the `net user` command and parses its output to enumerate all local user accounts on the Windows system.
- Username provides a list of accounts that exist locally, supporting account inventory, privilege review, and potential misuse investigation.
- Collected supplies a timestamp for when the enumeration occurred, aiding in audit trails and repeatability.
- Collecting local user account information is crucial for digital forensics, security auditing, and incident response, as it helps identify unauthorized, dormant, or suspicious user accounts that may present security risks.
