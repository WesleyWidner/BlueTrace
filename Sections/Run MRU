Information Pulled:  
- EntryKey: The name of the registry value (usually a single letter or number referencing the order in which the command was run)
- Command: The actual command entered by the user in the Windows Run dialog
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "RunMRU"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects entries from the RunMRU registry key, which records commands and file paths run by the user through the Windows Run dialog.
- EntryKey and Command reveal direct evidence of user-launched programs, scripts, or paths, which may indicate system configuration, application use, or attempted access to sensitive utilities.
- Collecting this data is valuable for digital forensics, user activity reconstruction, and incident response, as it helps track explicit actions and intentions of users or attackers interacting with the system.
