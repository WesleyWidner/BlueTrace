## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function checks for the existence of the SRUM database, which contains detailed system resource usage information, including app/network usage, energy consumption, and some user activity history.

SRUDB_Path and Note inform an analyst of the presence of this key forensic artifact and provide next steps for deeper analysis.  
The SRUM database is important for digital forensics, incident response, and activity reconstruction,  
as it can reveal patterns of application/network usage, logon activity, and system events even when traditional event logs have been cleared.
