Information Pulled:  
- Name: The name of each environment variable
- Value: The value assigned to each environment variable
- Scope: Specifies whether the variable is set at the "User" (current user only) or "System" (all users on the machine) level
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "EnvironmentVariables"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function gathers all environment variables defined for both the user and the system.  
- Name and Value provide details about the runtime configuration, paths, and settings that can influence how applications behave on the system.
- Scope indicates whether each variable affects just the current user or all users, which is important for understanding the variableâ€™s impact and for troubleshooting.
- Collecting environment variables is valuable for incident response, troubleshooting software issues, detecting malicious persistence methods, and auditing system configurations. Unusual or suspicious variables may indicate compromise or misconfiguration.
