Information Pulled:  
- RegistryPath: The full registry path of the Run or RunOnce key where the entry is found
- Name: The name of the registry value (the autostart entry label)
- Value: The full command line or value stored in the registry for autostart
- Executable: The path to the executable or script (extracted from the command line where possible)
- SHA256: The SHA-256 hash of the executable file (if found and accessible)
- Suspicious: Boolean flag indicating if the entry is potentially suspicious (e.g., launches from risky folders or runs scripts, batch files, or rundll32)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "RegistryRunKeys"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all autorun entries from common "Run" and "RunOnce" registry keys for both the current user and the system.
- RegistryPath, Name, and Value reveal what is set to launch automatically on startup or user login, which is critical for finding persistence mechanisms.
- Executable and SHA256 help identify the actual file being run and enable integrity checks or threat intelligence correlation.
- Suspicious highlights risky or non-standard entries (such as scripts or items launched via rundll32 or from temp/user folders) for further investigation.
- Collecting this data is essential for digital forensics, security auditing, and incident response, as malware and attackers often use these registry keys to maintain persistence.
