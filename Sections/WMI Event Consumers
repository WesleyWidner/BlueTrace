Information Pulled:  
- Name: The name of the WMI event consumer
- ConsumerType: The class/type of the WMI event consumer (e.g., CommandLineEventConsumer, ActiveScriptEventConsumer)
- CommandLine: The command line to be executed by the consumer (if available)
- Executable: The extracted path to the executable file (if available)
- Suspicious: Boolean flag indicating if the command line is potentially suspicious (e.g., involves scripts, PowerShell, or runs from risky folders)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "WMIEventConsumers"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all WMI event consumers in the system's `root\subscription` namespace and collects metadata about each one.
- Name and ConsumerType help identify the type and purpose of each event consumer, which are used by the WMI system to execute actions in response to certain triggers or events.
- CommandLine and Executable indicate what action or file will be executed when the event consumer is triggered, which is vital for detecting persistence mechanisms or potential abuse by attackers.
- Suspicious flags highlight consumers that run from non-standard or high-risk locations, or that use interpreters or scripts commonly abused by malware.
- Collecting this data is essential for security monitoring, digital forensics, and incident response, as malicious actors often use WMI event consumers for stealthy, persistent code execution.
