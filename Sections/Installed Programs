Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects details about all programs installed on the system by querying relevant registry paths for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, as well as per-user installations.  
- DisplayName and DisplayVersion help identify exactly what software is present and which versions are in use, which is essential for vulnerability management, software inventory, compliance audits, or incident response.
- Publisher provides information about the vendor, which can help distinguish legitimate software from potentially unwanted or suspicious programs.
- InstallDate is useful for tracking recent software installations that could be linked to security incidents or unauthorized changes.
- Aggregating this information gives a clear picture of the system's software footprint, supporting system health assessments and security investigations.
