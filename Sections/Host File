Information Pulled:  
- IPAddress: The IP address specified in each non-comment line of the hosts file
- Hostname: The hostname mapped to each IP address entry
- SHA256: The SHA-256 hash of the entire hosts file (or error status)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "HostsFile"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function parses the Windows hosts file and collects a mapping of static hostname-to-IP assignments along with a hash of the entire file.
- IPAddress and Hostname reveal custom DNS overrides or redirects, which are critical for identifying potential malware, adware, or manual configuration that could affect network behavior or security.
- SHA256 enables integrity checking, ensuring the hosts file has not been tampered with or altered unexpectedly.
- Collecting hosts file information is important for digital forensics, security auditing, troubleshooting DNS issues, and detecting unauthorized or malicious changes to system name resolution.
