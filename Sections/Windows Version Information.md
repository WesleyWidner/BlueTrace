## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function collects essential information about the Windows operating system version and its installation history.

Caption, Version, and BuildNumber help identify exactly which version and build of Windows is running, which is important for assessing compatibility, patch levels, and vulnerability exposure.  
Architecture clarifies if the OS is 32-bit or 64-bit, which affects software compatibility and some security controls.  
InstallDate can provide insights into the system’s lifecycle and help in investigations involving OS upgrades or reinstalls.  
LastBootUpTime is useful for uptime calculations and can help correlate system events with reboots, updates, or possible incident timelines.  
Collecting this information supports troubleshooting, asset management, incident response, and security compliance efforts.
