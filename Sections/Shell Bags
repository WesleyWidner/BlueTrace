Information Pulled:  
- Path: The registry path checked for ShellBag information (e.g., BagMRU, Bags under HKCU)
- Exists: Boolean indicating whether the registry key exists on the system
- LastWrite: The last modified timestamp of the registry key (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss or "N/A")
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "ShellBags"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function checks for the existence and last modification time of key ShellBag registry entries, which Windows uses to store folder view settings and track folder access/navigation history.
- Path and Exists indicate which ShellBag structures are present for the user, supporting validation and discovery during forensic analysis.
- LastWrite helps establish a timeline for when a user last interacted with or modified folder views, which can correlate with user activity or the presence of evidence in certain folders.
- Collecting ShellBag information is valuable for digital forensics and incident response, as ShellBags can reveal folder traversal and access even if files or shortcuts have been deleted or cleared.
