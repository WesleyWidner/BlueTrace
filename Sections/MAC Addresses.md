# üîê MAC Address and Network Adapter Metadata

## **Information Pulled:**  
InterfaceAlias ‚Äì The name or alias of each physical network adapter that is currently up  
MACAddress ‚Äì The MAC (Media Access Control) address of each network adapter  
LinkSpeed ‚Äì The connection speed of each network adapter  
Section ‚Äì Static identifier labeling the data as `"MACAddresses"`

---

## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function enumerates all physical network adapters that are currently active (status "Up") and collects key information for each.

InterfaceAlias and MACAddress uniquely identify each physical network interface, supporting asset tracking, network monitoring, and forensic investigations.  
LinkSpeed helps assess network capability and detect unusual network configurations.  
Collecting MAC address and interface data is important for digital forensics, network troubleshooting, inventory management, and security monitoring,  
as it provides a basis for correlating network activity with specific hardware on the system.
