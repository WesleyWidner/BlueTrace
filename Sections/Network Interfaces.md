# 🌐 Network Interface Metadata

## **Information Pulled:**  
Name – The name or alias of each network adapter on the system  
Status – The operational status of the adapter (e.g., Up, Down, Disabled)  
MACAddress – The MAC address of the network adapter  
LinkSpeed – The connection speed of the network interface  
InterfaceID – The index or identifier for the network interface  
Section – Static identifier labeling the data as `"Network Interfaces"`

---

## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function enumerates all network interfaces present on the system and collects key metadata for each.

Name, MACAddress, and InterfaceID uniquely identify each network adapter, supporting network inventory, device tracking, and troubleshooting.  
Status and LinkSpeed provide information on which adapters are active and at what speed, which is useful for diagnosing connectivity issues or understanding available network capabilities.  
Collecting network interface data is important for asset management, digital forensics, incident response, and network troubleshooting,  
as it gives a comprehensive overview of the network hardware available on the system.
