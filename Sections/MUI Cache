Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function parses the MUICache registry key, which tracks recently executed applications and their user interface display names on a per-user basis.
- Executable provides evidence of what programs have been run by the user, even if the binaries have been deleted or moved.
- Description helps identify each executable by its user-facing application name or title.
- Collecting MUICache entries is important for digital forensics, incident response, and activity reconstruction, as it gives a historical record of program execution and can reveal evidence of suspicious or rare applications having been launched on the system.
