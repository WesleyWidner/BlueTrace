Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function retrieves and parses the Windows RecentDocs registry key, collecting references to files that have been recently accessed by the current user.
- SubKey, ValueName, and RawValue reveal the types of documents accessed and their actual paths or identifiers, helping to reconstruct user activity and document usage.
- ValueType provides insight into how the recent document reference is stored, which can aid in further analysis.
- SHA256 enables integrity checking and identification of specific files accessed, which is valuable for digital forensics, user activity monitoring, and incident response.
- Collecting this data is important for tracking user actions, understanding recent file access patterns, and identifying potentially sensitive or exfiltrated documents.
