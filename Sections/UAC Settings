Information Pulled:  
- ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin: How User Account Control (UAC) prompts administrators (various prompt levels or silent elevation)
- ConsentPromptBehaviorUser: How UAC prompts standard users when elevation is requested
- EnableLUA: Whether UAC is enabled or disabled on the system
- PromptOnSecureDesktop: Whether UAC prompts are shown on a secure desktop (protects against spoofing)
- EnableVirtualization: Whether UAC file and registry virtualization is enabled (helps with legacy applications)
- ValidateAdminCodeSignatures: Whether admin code signatures are validated before running
- FilterAdministratorToken: Whether administrator accounts use a split or full security token
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "UACSettings"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects the key UAC (User Account Control) configuration settings from the system registry.
- These settings determine how Windows manages privilege elevation and how users are prompted for administrative actions.
- Reviewing these values is crucial for understanding the system's security posture, since relaxed UAC settings can increase the risk of privilege escalation and malware execution.
- Secure desktop and code signature validation help mitigate spoofing and ensure only trusted code is run with elevated permissions.
- Virtualization settings impact compatibility and containment of legacy applications.
- This data supports security audits, incident response, and compliance by showing how strictly Windows enforces elevation and admin actions.
