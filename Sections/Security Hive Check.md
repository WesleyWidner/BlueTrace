## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function checks for the presence of the SECURITY registry hive, which contains sensitive local security policy information, user rights assignments, and security identifiers.

Path and Exists allow analysts to confirm the presence and availability of this critical system hive for forensic imaging or offline analysis.  
Note provides guidance for proper handling and analysis, since the hive is in binary format and not human-readable.  
Collecting the SECURITY hive is important for digital forensics, security auditing, and incident response,  
as it contains historical and current security policy configurations, audit policy, and account rights information that can be used to track changes, detect unauthorized privilege escalation, or support investigations of malicious activity.
