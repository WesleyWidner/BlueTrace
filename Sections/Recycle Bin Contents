Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects information about all items currently in the user's Recycle Bin.
- OriginalPath and Name help identify what was deleted and from where, supporting recovery operations or investigations into potential data removal.
- DeletedDate allows for establishing a timeline of file deletion activity, which can be useful for forensic investigations or compliance tracking.
- SizeBytes helps assess the storage impact of deleted files and prioritize recovery or investigation efforts.
- SHA256 provides a unique cryptographic identifier for each file (when available), supporting file integrity checks, detection of sensitive data, or correlation with known threat databases.
- Gathering this information is valuable for incident response, digital forensics, and monitoring for suspicious or unauthorized deletion of important files.
