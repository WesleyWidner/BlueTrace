## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function gathers fundamental system and user session details necessary for incident response, auditing, or troubleshooting.

Hostname, UserDomain, and Username uniquely identify the machine and current user context‚Äîuseful for correlating logs or tracking user activity.  
SID is critical for uniquely identifying users, especially in environments with identical usernames across domains.  
IsAdmin reveals whether the script has elevated privileges, affecting the ability to perform certain actions or access protected data.  
SystemTimeLocal and SystemTimeUTC provide precise timing for events, supporting log correlation and forensic timelines.  
TimeZone helps interpret timestamps in the context of the machine‚Äôs location.  
BootTime establishes how long the system has been running, which can help detect recent reboots (possibly related to incidents or updates).
