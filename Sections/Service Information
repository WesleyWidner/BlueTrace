Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all Windows services and collects detailed metadata about each one.
- Name, DisplayName, State, and StartMode provide an overview of all services and their operational status, which is essential for system monitoring and auditing.
- PathName and Executable identify what is actually run when the service starts, supporting detection of potentially unwanted or malicious services.
- SHA256 and digital signature fields (IsSigned, SignatureStatus, Publisher) enable integrity checks, threat hunting, and identification of trusted vs. untrusted code.
- Suspicious flags help focus attention on services that are unsigned, use scripts, or reside in non-standard or high-risk locations.
- Description supplies additional context to aid in the identification and validation of each service's purpose.
- Collecting this information is crucial for digital forensics, security auditing, incident response, and system hardening, as malicious actors often use services for persistence or privilege escalation.
