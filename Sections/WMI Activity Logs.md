## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function collects recent events from the Windows WMI Activity Operational log, which records detailed activity for all WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) operations.

TimeCreated, EventID, and EventType provide essential timeline and classification data for each event.  
ProcessID and User identify who initiated the activity, supporting attribution and investigation of potentially malicious or unauthorized activity.  
Operation, Namespace, and Query provide context on exactly what was being accessed or executed, helping in threat hunting, security auditing, and troubleshooting.  
Collecting and analyzing WMI activity is critical for incident response and digital forensics, as attackers often abuse WMI for persistence, lateral movement, and execution of malicious code.
