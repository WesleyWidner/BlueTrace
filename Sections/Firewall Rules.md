## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function enumerates all configured Windows Firewall rules on the system and collects their key properties.

Name, Direction, and Action give a clear description of what traffic is being allowed or blocked and in which direction.  
Enabled indicates which rules are actively enforced, assisting with compliance and security validation.  
Profile reveals the network environment (Domain, Private, Public) where each rule applies, allowing targeted policy analysis.  
Collecting firewall rule information is essential for security auditing, troubleshooting network issues,  
verifying compliance, and identifying misconfigurations or unauthorized changes that may impact system security.
