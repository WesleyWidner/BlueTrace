Information Pulled:  
- MountPoint: The drive letter or mount point for each volume
- VolumeType: The type of volume (e.g., Fixed, Removable)
- ProtectionStatus: Indicates if BitLocker protection is on, off, or suspended
- EncryptionMethod: The algorithm/method used for encryption
- EncryptionPercentage: How much of the volume is currently encrypted
- KeyProtector: The types of BitLocker key protectors present (e.g., password, TPM, recovery key)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "BitLockerStatus"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects the encryption status for all detected disk volumes using BitLocker.
- Details such as ProtectionStatus, EncryptionMethod, and EncryptionPercentage are vital for determining if data on the system is protected at rest.
- KeyProtector types indicate how encryption keys are managed, which impacts recoverability and attack surface.
- This information is critical for compliance validation, digital forensics, and incident response, providing insight into whether sensitive data may be protected or exposed if drives are removed or stolen.
