Information Pulled:  
- TaskName: The name of each scheduled task
- TaskPath: The path of each scheduled task in Task Scheduler
- State: The current status of the task (e.g., Ready, Running, Disabled)
- LastRunTime: The last time the task was run (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss or "Never")
- NextRunTime: The next scheduled run time for the task (if available)
- LastResult: The last result or exit code of the task's last run
- Hidden: Boolean indicating if the task is hidden from standard Task Scheduler views
- Principal: The user account under which the task runs
- Action: The command(s) or executable(s) the task runs
- Trigger: The trigger(s) for the task (e.g., schedule, at logon)
- SHA256: The SHA-256 hash of the executable/action for the task (if resolvable)
- SuspiciousPath: Boolean flag indicating if the task's action points to suspicious locations (e.g., AppData, Temp, Downloads, or user profile directories)
- SuspiciousTrigger: Boolean flag indicating if the task uses suspicious or high-risk triggers (e.g., running late at night, at logon, or with repetition)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "ScheduledTasks"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all scheduled tasks on the system and gathers detailed metadata about each one.
- TaskName, TaskPath, State, Action, and Trigger allow for identification and review of what each scheduled task does and when it executes.
- Principal identifies the user context, which is crucial for assessing privilege levels and risk.
- LastRunTime, NextRunTime, and LastResult provide execution history for auditing, troubleshooting, and incident investigation.
- Hidden and SuspiciousPath/SuspiciousTrigger flags help quickly spot stealthy or potentially malicious tasks that could be used for persistence, privilege escalation, or lateral movement.
- SHA256 supports file integrity checks and threat hunting by providing a unique hash for each executable or script run by a task.
- Collecting this information is essential for security monitoring, compliance auditing, digital forensics, and detecting unauthorized or malicious persistence mechanisms.
