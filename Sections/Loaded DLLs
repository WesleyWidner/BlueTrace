Information Pulled:  
- ProcessName: The name of the process in which each DLL/module is loaded
- PID: The process ID for each process
- ModuleName: The name of the loaded DLL or module
- FilePath: The file system path to the DLL or module file
- SHA256: The SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the DLL file (or error indicator)
- Signature: The Authenticode digital signature status of the DLL file (e.g., Valid, Invalid, or error indicator)
- CompanyName: The company name from the DLL's version info (if available)
- SuspiciousPath: Boolean indicating whether the DLL is loaded from potentially suspicious locations (such as AppData, Temp, Roaming, or Downloads)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "LoadedDLLs"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all DLLs (modules) loaded into running processes, along with relevant metadata for each.
- ProcessName, PID, ModuleName, and FilePath provide precise context on which processes are using which DLLs and where those DLLs reside on disk.
- SHA256 uniquely identifies the DLL for integrity checks, threat intelligence matching, or further forensic analysis.
- Signature and CompanyName assist in distinguishing trusted, signed modules from unsigned or suspicious third-party code.
- SuspiciousPath flags modules loaded from unusual or high-risk directories, which are often used by malware or attackers for persistence or injection.
- Collecting this data is vital for security monitoring, digital forensics, malware detection, and understanding the operational context of system and third-party code in memory.
