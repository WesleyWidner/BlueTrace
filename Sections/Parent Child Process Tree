Information Pulled:  
- ProcessName: The name of each process
- ProcessId: The unique process ID (PID) for each process
- ParentProcessId: The process ID of the parent (which process launched this one)
- ExecutablePath: The file system path to the process's executable (if available)
- CommandLine: The command line string used to launch the process (if available)
- CreationDate: The timestamp when the process was started (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss or "Unavailable")
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "ParentChildProcessTree"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all processes and reconstructs their parent-child relationships, providing a detailed process tree for the system.
- ProcessName, ProcessId, and ParentProcessId reveal how processes are spawned and linked, which is critical for identifying suspicious or malicious process chains.
- ExecutablePath and CommandLine provide insight into how and from where each process was launched, aiding in security investigations and incident response.
- CreationDate helps build a timeline of process activity, supporting event correlation and anomaly detection.
- Collecting parent-child process data is essential for digital forensics, security monitoring, and troubleshooting, as it exposes potentially unwanted or attacker-controlled process hierarchies and execution paths.
