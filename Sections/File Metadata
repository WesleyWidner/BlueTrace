Information Pulled:  
- Name: The name of each file in the user's profile directory (recursively)
- FullPath: The complete file system path to each file
- CreationTime: The timestamp when each file was created (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)
- LastModified: The timestamp when each file was last modified (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)
- LastAccessed: The timestamp when each file was last accessed (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)
- SHA256: The SHA-256 cryptographic hash of each file's contents
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "FileMetadata"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects comprehensive metadata for all files within the user's profile directory, including subdirectories.
- Name and FullPath allow precise identification and location of files, which is vital for investigations and audits.
- CreationTime, LastModified, and LastAccessed provide a complete activity timeline for each file, useful for forensic analysis, incident response, and detecting unusual or suspicious behavior (such as unauthorized access or changes).
- SHA256 supplies a unique cryptographic fingerprint for each file, enabling file integrity checks, tampering detection, and correlation with known malicious files or threat intelligence databases.
- This detailed file inventory supports data loss prevention, compliance efforts, and investigations into user activity or potential security incidents.
