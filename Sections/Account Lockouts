**Information Pulled:  
- TimeCreated: The timestamp when each account lockout event was generated (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)
- User: The username associated with the lockout event (extracted from the event message if available)
- Message: The full event log message text (condensed for readability)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "AccountLockouts"

**Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function retrieves and parses recent account lockout events (Event ID 4740) from the Windows Security Event Log.
- TimeCreated and User allow for identification of when and for which account lockouts occurred, aiding in timeline and user-specific analysis.
- Message provides detailed context for each lockout event, supporting forensic investigations and detection of brute-force attacks, misconfigurations, or suspicious account activity.
- Collecting account lockout data is important for security monitoring, incident response, and compliance, as repeated or unexplained lockouts can be an indicator of attempted unauthorized access or account misuse.
