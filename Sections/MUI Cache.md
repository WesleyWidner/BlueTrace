## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function parses the MUICache registry key, which tracks recently executed applications and their user interface display names on a per-user basis.

Executable provides evidence of what programs have been run by the user, even if the binaries have been deleted or moved.  
Description helps identify each executable by its user-facing application name or title.  
Collecting MUICache entries is important for digital forensics, incident response, and activity reconstruction,  
as it gives a historical record of program execution and can reveal evidence of suspicious or rare applications having been launched on the system.
