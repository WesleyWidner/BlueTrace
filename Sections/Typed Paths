Information Pulled:  
- EntryName: The name of the registry value (typically in the format url1, url2, etc.)
- PathValue: The actual path or URL typed by the user into Windows Explorer's address bar
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "TypedPaths"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function retrieves data from the TypedPaths registry key, which tracks file system paths and URLs entered by the user into the Windows Explorer address bar.
- EntryName and PathValue reveal direct user navigation, showing what locations have been accessed or browsed, regardless of whether the user used links or shortcuts.
- Collecting this data is useful for digital forensics, user activity monitoring, and incident response, as it provides insight into user intent and access historyâ€”potentially exposing attempted access to sensitive, remote, or otherwise noteworthy folders or shares.
