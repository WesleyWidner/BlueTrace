## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function checks for the presence of the UsrClass.dat registry hive, which stores user-specific Windows Explorer settings, ShellBag information (folder view history), and Jump List data (recent app/file activity).

Path and Exists help forensic analysts confirm whether this key user registry hive is available for further analysis.  
Note offers guidance for deeper investigation using common forensic tools.  
UsrClass.dat is a critical artifact for digital forensics, incident response, and user activity reconstruction,  
as it can reveal historical folder access, desktop layout, and recent file/app usage even when other evidence has been cleared.
