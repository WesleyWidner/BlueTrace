## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function gathers detailed information about all files located on the user's Desktop.

Name and FullPath identify where files are located and what they are called, which can be important in tracking user activity and understanding file organization.  
LastModified records when files were last changed, which is valuable for forensic analysis, incident response, or detecting recent suspicious activity.  
SHA256 provides a unique hash for each file, enabling reliable file identification, detecting tampering, or checking for known malicious files by hash comparison.  
Collecting this information helps monitor critical user-facing files, supports investigations into data exfiltration or modification,  
and assists in compliance with security policies regarding sensitive files.
