Information Pulled:  
- Name: The name of each running process
- Id: The process ID (PID) of each running process
- Path: The file system path to the executable for each process (if accessible; otherwise "ACCESS_DENIED" or "N/A")
- StartTime: The timestamp when each process was started (if accessible; otherwise "ACCESS_DENIED")
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "RunningProcesses"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function collects information about all currently running processes on the system.
- Name and Id uniquely identify each process, which is useful for system monitoring, troubleshooting, and correlation with security events.
- Path shows the location of the executable file for each process, helping identify legitimate versus suspicious or potentially malicious processes.
- StartTime indicates when the process began, which aids in timeline reconstruction for incident response and in identifying long-running or recently started processes.
- Collecting this data supports system health checks, digital forensics, security monitoring, and can help detect unauthorized or anomalous processes running on the system.
