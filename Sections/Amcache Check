Information Pulled:  
- File: The name of the file checked ("Amcache.hve")
- Path: The full file path to Amcache.hve
- Exists: Indicates whether the file was found ("Yes" or "No")
- Note: Description indicating the file is a binary registry hive and suggesting use of an external parser (such as AmcacheParser)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "AmcacheCheck"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function checks for the presence of the Amcache.hve registry hive, which contains historical data about executables, installers, and device drivers that have run on the system.
- Amcache.hve is a valuable forensic artifact that records program execution and can be parsed to build a timeline of software usage and installation.
- Path and Exists help determine if this artifact is available for deeper forensic analysis.
- Note guides the analyst to appropriate tools for parsing, since the file is in binary format.
- Collecting Amcache information is important for digital forensics, incident response, and threat hunting, as it often preserves evidence of execution even after files or logs have been deleted.
