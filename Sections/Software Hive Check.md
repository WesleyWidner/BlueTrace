## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function checks for the presence of the SOFTWARE registry hive file, which stores information about installed applications, OS components, and configuration settings.

Path and Exists show whether the hive can be collected for forensic or offline analysis.  
The Note field provides guidance, as SOFTWARE is a binary file requiring special registry tools for detailed examination.  
The SOFTWARE hive is a core forensic artifact for investigations and incident response, enabling analysts to recover details about software installation, updates, application usage, and malware persistence mechanisms.
