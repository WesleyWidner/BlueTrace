## **Purpose & Usefulness:**  
This function checks for the existence of the RecentFileCache.bcf file, which contains binary data about recently accessed or executed programs.

Path and SHA256 are used for integrity validation and further analysis with specialized tools.  
Note provides context for analysts, clarifying that while the file is present, its binary format requires external utilities for meaningful interpretation.  
Collecting this artifact is important for digital forensics, incident response, and timeline reconstruction,  
as it can contain evidence of program execution not found in other logs or artifacts.
