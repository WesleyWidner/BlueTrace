Information Pulled:  
- RecordName: The domain name queried and cached by the system DNS resolver
- RecordType: The DNS record type (e.g., "A (Host Address)", "CNAME (Canonical Name)", "AAAA (IPv6 Address)", or "Other")
- TTL: The remaining Time To Live (in seconds) for the cache entry
- Data: The record data (such as IP address for an A record, or target hostname for a CNAME)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "DNSCache"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function parses the system's DNS resolver cache, displaying all cached DNS records with their type, data, and expiry.
- RecordName, RecordType, and Data provide visibility into recent and current domain resolutions by the system, supporting investigation of user and process network activity.
- TTL helps analysts understand when the cached entry is set to expire, useful for timeline analysis.
- Collecting DNS cache information is valuable for digital forensics, incident response, and network monitoring, as it can reveal evidence of connections to suspicious, malicious, or noteworthy domainsâ€”even if browser or application history has been cleared.
