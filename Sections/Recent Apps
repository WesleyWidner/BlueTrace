Information Pulled:  
- AppID: The unique identifier for each recently used application, as stored in the registry
- Executable: The path or name of the application's executable file
- LastAccessTime: The last time the application was accessed or used (raw registry value, may need conversion)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "RecentApps"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function parses the RecentApps registry key, which tracks applications that have been recently accessed or launched by the user through Windows Search.
- AppID and Executable provide a mapping of recent program usage, allowing investigators to identify what apps were recently run.
- LastAccessTime can help build a timeline of user activity, which is critical for digital forensics, incident response, and behavioral analysis.
- Collecting recent application usage data supports detection of suspicious or rare activity, reconstruction of user actions, and validation of incident timelines.
