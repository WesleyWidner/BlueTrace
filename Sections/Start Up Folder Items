Information Pulled:  
- User: The user account associated with each Startup folder item
- ItemName: The name of the file (shortcut, script, or executable) found in a Startup folder
- FullPath: The complete file system path to the Startup item
- LastModified: The last modified timestamp of the Startup item
- SHA256: The SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the Startup item (for integrity and threat hunting)
- Suspicious: Boolean flag indicating if the item is potentially suspicious (e.g., located in risky folders or is a script or shortcut file)
- Section: Static identifier labeling the data as "StartupFolderItems"

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function enumerates all files in the Startup folders for the current user, all users, and each profile on the system, collecting detailed metadata for each item.
- User, ItemName, and FullPath allow clear attribution and location of auto-starting programs, which is essential for investigating persistence mechanisms.
- LastModified shows when each item was last changed, supporting timeline analysis and detecting recent additions or modifications.
- SHA256 uniquely identifies each file for integrity checks and correlation with threat intelligence or known malware.
- Suspicious flags quickly highlight items that might represent malicious persistence (such as scripts, links, or items in risky locations).
- Collecting this information is vital for digital forensics, incident response, security auditing, and detection of unauthorized or malicious programs set to run at login or system start.
