- Account: The username/account name that logged in (extracted from the event message)
- LogonType: The numeric logon type (e.g., 2 for interactive, 3 for network, etc.)

Purpose & Usefulness:  
This function retrieves recent successful logon events (Event ID 4624) from the Security Event Log and extracts key fields for each.
- TimeCreated, Account, LogonType, and LogonID allow you to reconstruct user authentication activity, track specific sessions, and identify logon methods.
- Message provides the raw context for deeper forensic review or correlation.
- Collecting this data is critical for digital forensics, security monitoring, and incident response, as it helps identify legitimate or suspicious logons, detect lateral movement, and support investigations into unauthorized access.
